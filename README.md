A new flutter plugin project that wraps ottu_ios_sdk for apple payment.

## Getting Started

fastest way to test the plugin is after moving to the project folder in terminal
- start by running: `futter pub get`  this should get the libraries for both the plugin and example projects
- then move to the example folder in ternimal and run `flutter build ios`
- or if an ios device is available, just `flutter run`
- or you can move to the ios folder in terminal and run `pod install`
- then just open the xcode workspace and hit run
